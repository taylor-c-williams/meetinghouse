      <h2>To The Management of Meetinghouse Sellwood:</h2>
      <p>
        We, the residents of Meetinghouse Sellwood apartments formally demand
        the presence of on site security, to be posted in the
        mailroom/entrance/parking garage common areas. As residents we have the
        right to a habitable home per Oregon State Law, Chapter 90, stating
        tenant's right to a habitable home, meaning the property must be safe
        and sanitary*. Our home is not safe, henceforth the management is not
        abiding by State Law. Our mailroom is constantly tampered with, stolen
        from, and ransacked. It is not safe. Our parking garage that we pay a
        special fee to use is constantly broken into, cars and bicycles damaged
        and stolen from, ransacked. It is not safe. If all residents are using
        best judgement, not allowing strangers in, utilizing package concierge,
        keeping cars inconspicuous, then we have done all we can and yet there
        is still thievery and vandalism. That stated, it is an entirely
        reasonable request to have on site, in building security 24/7. A refusal
        of this reasonable demand is simply unconscionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sincerely,
        <br />
        Your Residents
      </p>
