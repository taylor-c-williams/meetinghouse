      MEETING HOUSE RESIDENTS December 23. 2021
      <br />
      The Management of Meetinghouse Sellwood
      <p>
        To whom it may concern, We, the residents of Meetinghouse Sellwood
        apartments, formally demand the presence of on sight security to be
        posted in the mailroom/entrance/parking garage. As residents we have the
        right to a habitable home per Oregon State laws stating "Tenants right
        to a habitable home, meaning the property must be safe and sanitary."
        Our home is not safe, henceforth The Management is not abiding by state
        law. Our mailroom is constantly tampered with, stolen from, and
        ransacked. It is not safe. Our parking garage that we pay a special fee
        to use is constantly broken into, cars damaged and stolen from,
        ransacked. It is not sate. If all residents are of sound mind, using
        best judgement, not allowing strangers in, utilizing package concierge,
        keeping cars inconspicuous. Then we have done all we can and yet there
        is still thievery and vandalism. That stated it is entirely a reasonable
        request to have on sight in building security 24/7. A refusal of this
        reasonable demand is simply unconscionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sincerely,
        <br />
        Your Residents
